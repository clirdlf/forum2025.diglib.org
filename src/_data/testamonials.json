It's the most comfortable I've ever felt at a professional conference, and I think the focus on inclusion and accessibility is a large part of that. The conference culture is excellent -- people were attentive in sessions, asked good questions, and seemed overall supportive rather than competitive or critical of each other's work. I really appreciated that."

It's very easy to feel like you don't really know if you're doing enough, or doing too much, or not doing the work correctly, and so these once-a-year (or more) opportunities to meet up with other professionals and be reminded that you're all basically in the same boat is very reassuring."
