    "quote": "As a first-time attendee, I found DLF to be a welcoming environment and filled with relevant information for my work. It's the most comfortable I've ever felt at a professional conference, and I think the focus on inclusion and accessibility is a large part of that. The conference culture is excellent -- people were attentive in sessions, asked good questions, and seemed overall supportive rather than competitive or critical of each other's work. I really appreciated that."

    "quote": "Hearing how other people tackled the task of migrating repository platforms was very helpful. Also just meeting new people in the field and learning about what they do. It's very easy to feel like you don't really know if you're doing enough, or doing too much, or not doing the work correctly, and so these once-a-year (or more) opportunities to meet up with other professionals and be reminded that you're all basically in the same boat is very reassuring."

    "quote": "This was my first DLF and honestly it helped me feel so much more confident in my new role. It felt like I wasn’t the only person with questions or hesitations about some of the issues we are having. A lot of the programming directly spoke to projects or initiatives I am working on day-to-day so it was very practical."

    "quote": "It’s great to see what everyone is working on, and this conference has a really wide range of presentations from theory to execution and different types of skills for different interests...DLF is by far my favorite conference, partly because I feel so cared for by the way the planning committee clearly focuses on fitting everyone’s diverse needs and partly because the sessions are always so good!"

    "quote": "The thoughtful way the experience was designed was due to the efforts of the organizers...As a first-time participant, I am grateful to have been able to participate in this year’s virtual Forum and look forward to continuing to learn from the DLF community!"
