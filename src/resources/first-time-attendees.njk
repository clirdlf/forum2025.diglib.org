            We hope our first-time attendees will feel empowered and comfortable when they attend our events. The DLF Community Committee typically plans social and newcomers' events &mdash; check the Wellness and Activities page for more information.

            There's no strict dress code at the Forum, but attendees tend to gravitate towards business casual attire. See photos from <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://forum2023.diglib.org/about/photo-gallery/">previous forums</a> for a better idea. Additionally, meeting rooms can be chilly, so consider keeping a sweater or jacket on hand just in case.

        <p class="my-10 block font-sans text-base font-normal leading-relaxed text-inherit !text-gray-600 antialiased">
            All sessions at the Forum are open to anyoneâ€”Working Group meetings (aka DLF Working Sessions) included. Please feel free to join these whether you're interested in joining group activities or just learning more about them.
        </p>

        <p class="my-10 block font-sans text-base font-normal leading-relaxed text-inherit !text-gray-600 antialiased">
            We are completely aware of how hard conferencing can be, and want you to have a good experience. Know it's ok to leave a session if it's not what you were expecting, or to miss one entirely because you're otherwise occupied or just need a break. There will be a designated Quiet Room onsite for anyone who wants to recharge or get some work done. 
        </p>

            Have you ever witnessed bullying, harassment, or an uncomfortable encounter in a professional context and wished you knew how to intervene? It can be challenging to know what to say or do on the spot. The DLF Code of Conduct invites participants to be Active Bystanders, but what does that really mean?
