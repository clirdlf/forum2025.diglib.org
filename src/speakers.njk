            Oftentimes, we are told in professional spaces that we are to be seen and not heard, but with the uptick of online gender-based violence impacting the most marginalized, we cannot afford to be silent. In this talk, Dr. KáLyn Coghill will discuss the precaritization of online gender-based violence, how it impacts us all, and how we can take steps to protect not only others but ourselves. This is not a request nor is it a suggestion; it is a demand and a clarion call for us to prioritize the experiences of those battling gender-based violence online and use our tools, skills, and resources to mitigate these harms and protect them.
